This repository contains code I implemented for anything I found to be interesting and/or weird. This could be an intriguing mathematical or physical phenomena, or a cool algorithm worth coding and visualizing. 

Listed below are the contents of the repositories, linking to where I initially came across them, that inspired me to code them up.
